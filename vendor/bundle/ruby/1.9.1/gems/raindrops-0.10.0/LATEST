=== raindrops 0.10.0 - minor feature updates / 2012-06-19 08:30 UTC

  Improvements to the Unix domain socket handling and small
  bugfixes throughout.

  Support for the "unix_diag" facility in Linux 3.3+ is planned
  but not yet implemented (patches to raindrops@librelist.org
  appreciated)

  Brian Corrigan (1):
        resolve symlinks to Unix domain sockets

  Eric Wong (6):
        unix_listener_stats follows and remembers symlinks
        middleware/proxy: favor __send__ for method dispatch
        unix: show zero-value stats for idle listeners
        test_watcher: fix incorrect request/date comparison
        watcher: sort index of listener listing
        watcher: do not require Rack::Head for HEAD response

  See "git log v0.9.0..v0.10.0" for full details
